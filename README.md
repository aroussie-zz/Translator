# Context

The idea of Translator comes from when I decided I wanted to learn a new language.
There are already on the stores several apps that will give the users built-in exercices in order to learn but they

- are usually focused on "learning by repitition" where users will have to keep doing the exercises to learn why the correct answers are actually correct
- don't give the ability to take notes within the app
- don't provide courses or notes about grammar or conjugation

I struggled with the fact that my way of learning was usually not fitting the way that the apps on store were trying to teach me. Or at least, I was missing some features that are useful to me.

# Translator

This is how my idea of Translator was borned. I wanted an app where: 

- I can translate sentences from one language to another, and **save** them within the app
- I can write notes of my own, either **plain text notes** or the **conjugation of verbs**
- I can **create my own exercices**. Similarly to a student who would have learnt all  his/her notes, and then try to test himself/herself on them

I write Translator using Flutter from Google so the app can work on both Android and iOS devices from the same code base.
